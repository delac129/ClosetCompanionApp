 1. **Why this Project?**
  - People own a lot of clothes, but only a small percentage of it actually gets worn on a daily basis. We often lose and/or forget about our clothes, because of this, we are inclined to buy more clothes, wasting valuable time and money. With all the options of clothes to wear people have a hard time deciding what outfits to pick. Our app will allow people to keep track of their clothes, in an effort to solve these problems. It will allow users to see, catalog and arrange the clothes that they own.
